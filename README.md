What's Inside? 🧐
This README will walk you through everything - from how the system works to setting it up on your machine. So, let's get started!

Front-end Magic ✨
The front-end is what you see - the cool buttons, pages, and all that jazz. It's built with ReactJS, a tech that makes things look awesome and work smoothly. It talks to the back-end using something called RESTful API calls, which is just a way of saying they chat and share info.

Pages You'll See 📚
For Students:

Homepage: The starting point, with links to courses and your details.
Catalog: Check out different course categories.
Course List: A list of all courses with details and ratings.

Cart Checkout: Buy your selected courses hassle-free.
Course Content: Dive into the course materials.
User Details: Know everything about your account.
User Edit Details: Make your account truly yours.

Tech Behind the Scenes 🛠️
For the cool stuff on the front-end, I used ReactJS, CSS for styling, Tailwind to make things pretty, and Redux to keep things organized.

Back-end Magic 🖥️
Now, let's talk about the back-end - the brain behind everything. It's like the engine room, making sure everything runs smoothly. I used NodeJS and ExpressJS for this part, and they work together to handle user accounts, courses, payments, and more.

What It Can Do 🚀

User Authentication and Authorization: Sign up, log in, and keep things secure.

Cloud-based Media Management: All our images, videos, and documents are stored and managed by Cloudinary.
Markdown Formatting: Courses are stored in Markdown format for a cool display.
Login with Google: Users can now log in seamlessly using their Google accounts.
Tools in Action 🛠️
For this part, I used Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB to store all the info, JWT for security, Bcrypt to keep passwords safe, Mongoose to help with the database, Cookie parser for cookies (not the tasty kind!), Nodemailer to send emails, and Razorpay for payments.

Database World 📊
Our info hangs out in MongoDB, a super-flexible database. It keeps everything organized, from course content to user data.
